# LUKSO-Hackathon-
This is an Universal Profile creation tool
This is a project I worked on for a Hackathon for Lukso Blockchain.
It's not optimized for windows, I suggest using Linux.
You need to install the modules before it works.
This little script lets you create a custom (name, description, tags, and one link URL of your choice) Universal Profile, however, it's not fully developed since you can't upload images for the universal profile.
